# accounts.py Design

This module will contain an `Account` class that manages user account activities within a trading simulation platform. The class contains various methods to conduct transactions, calculate portfolio values, and manage user holdings. Below is the detailed design of the class and methods:

## Class: `Account`

### Attributes
- `user_id`: A unique identifier for each account holder.
- `balance`: The current balance of cash in the account.
- `holdings`: A dictionary mapping of stock symbols to quantities owned.
- `transactions`: A list of transaction records detailing each buy/sell action.
- `initial_deposit`: The initial amount of cash deposited.

### Methods

#### `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float)`
Constructor to initialize an account.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user_id` (str): The user's unique identifier.
  - `initial_deposit` (float): The amount of initial deposit.
- **Functionality**: Sets up the account with the initial deposit, initializes balance, holdings, and transactions.

#### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
Deposit funds into the account.
- **Parameters**:
  - `amount` (float): The amount to deposit.
- **Functionality**: Increases the account balance by the deposit amount.

#### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
Withdraw funds from the account.
- **Parameters**:
  - `amount` (float): The amount to withdraw.
- **Functionality**: Decreases the account balance by the withdraw amount if sufficient funds are available.
- **Returns**: `True` if the withdrawal was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Buy a specified number of shares.
- **Parameters**:
  - `symbol` (str): The ticker symbol of the shares to buy.
  - `quantity` (int): The number of shares to buy.
- **Functionality**: Checks if enough funds are available; if so, deducts the total price from balance, increases holdings, and records the transaction.
- **Returns**: `True` if the purchase was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Sell a specified number of shares.
- **Parameters**:
  - `symbol` (str): The ticker symbol of the shares to sell.
  - `quantity` (int): The number of shares to sell.
- **Functionality**: Checks if enough shares are available; if so, increases the balance by the total sale price, decreases holdings, and records the transaction.
- **Returns**: `True` if the sale was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
Calculate the total value of the user's portfolio.
- **Returns**: The sum of the cash balance and market value of all shares held.

#### `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
Calculate the profit or loss based on initial deposit.
- **Returns**: The net profit or loss figure as balance + current portfolio value â€“ initial deposit.

#### `report_holdings(self) -> dict`
Return a summary of current holdings.
- **Returns**: A dictionary mapping symbols to quantities of shares held.

#### `report_transactions(self) -> list`
List all transactions made by the user.
- **Returns**: A list of dictionaries, with each transaction's details.

#### `get_share_price(self, symbol: str) -> float`
Retrieve the current price of a specific share.
- **Parameters**:
  - `symbol` (str): The ticker symbol for which to get the price.
- **Functionality**: Calls the provided `get_share_price(symbol)` function to obtain the share price.
- **Returns**: The current share price for the given symbol.

Ensure to handle exceptions and invalid operations such as insufficient balance or invalid symbols within each method to maintain robustness in the module.
